Arctic Tern is smaller, with a smaller head, neck and bill and slightly narrower wings, which look forwardly placed on the body. Very short legs. Adults have a blood red bill, usually with no dark tip. The underparts are greyer than Common Tern and there some contrast with the cheek. The wing pattern is useful in separation, Arctic terns shows no dark wedge in the primaries but shows a distinct trailing edge. Arctic terns have longer tail steamers, extending beyond the wing tips.

In Ireland, it is a widespread breeding bird but nowhere is it numerous. Found on mountains, moorland and lowland raised bogs, where it is associated with heather, from which it gains the majority of its food, Some birds will also venture into woodland. As a 'game' species it had benefited from past management of heather moorland, which has declined in Ireland. Densities in Ireland are much lower in than in parts of northern England and eastern Scotland, where carefully controlled burning of heather takes place and provides enhanced nesting and feeding opportunities. The national Red Grouse Survey 2006-08,andshowed the species to occur in Co. Wicklow, Co. Laois, Co. Waterford, and along the western seaboard from Co. Donegal to Co.

Both sexes take part in the construction of the nest. Kites generally build their own nest, but may take over an old crow or buzzard nest. Nests are commonly placed in a large strong fork near the stem, they may occasionally be placed out on the end of a large branch. Kites line their nests with wool and often decorate them with rubbish such as plastic bags and scraps of cloth. Egg laying starts in April and the eggs are laid at 1-3 day intervals. Incubation takes 31-32 days and the eggs hatch asynchronously, that is they do not all hatch together but hatch some days apart. The chicks are brooded by the female for the first few weeks of their lives. During this stage the male must supply all of the food, later in the breeding season the female assists him in providing food for the chicks. The chicks leave the nest, fledge, at 7-8 weeks.

Birds are collected from nests in the donor area, Wales, at 5-7 weeks of age. After collection, the young kites are transported by road and ferry to the holding aviaries in Wicklow. The birds are fed and reared in the aviaries and when old enough are released into the wild. Prior to release, all birds are fitted with individual wing tags and radio transmitters to ensure the effective post-release monitoring of the fate of individual birds. Breeding was attempted in 2009 and two nests with eggs were identified. However, both failed to hatch. In 2010 however, the first Irish born Red Kite chicks were discovered in a nest in Co. Wicklow.

Told apart from other species of crow by its 'trousers' the dropping feathers on its belly and the bare skin around its bill base on the adult birds. Juveniles lack this feature, which only develops in the spring of its second year, and then they can be difficult to separate from Carrion Crows (a rare breeder in Ireland); best told apart by the more peaked crown of the Rook. Often forages in the company of other crow species, especially Jackdaws. When separating Hooded Crows and Rooks in flight, Rooks has faster and deeper wingbeats, which makes it look like they are making more effort than the Hooded Crow. ",
